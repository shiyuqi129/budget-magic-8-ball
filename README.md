# Budget Magic 8 Ball
Ask a question (Y/N) Get an answer!

### Disclaimer:
This program is made for fun. Do not listen to anything it says. It is important for users to have free will and not listen to random programs. If you ever got yourself into trouble after following the program's advice, it is totally on you for not thinking for yourself. Alas, use your brain to make any decision.

### Description:
This program can help you make all your important life choices, although that is not recommended. To use this program, type in your question (ideally a yes or no question), and the program will respond (or not if it does not feel like it). It is completely normal for the program to produce seemingly nonsensical responses; that is because it literally does not care about your question and has a mind of its own. If you want a better answer, ask a better question.

### Contribution:
I believe you have better things to do than contribute to this repo. But if you insist, do whatever you want and pray for mercy from this evil program because any suggestion has a chance to be rejected by either the author or the Budget Magic 8 Ball itself.

### Prerequisite:
- Python 3.13 (Or any version that works, I'm not checking)
- A working device
- A functioning brain
- [Optional] The ability to read English
- [Recommended] Frog
